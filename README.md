# Locket

Locket is a privacy-focused, daily journal.

Sign in with your username and password or create an account.

You can turn on "Incognito Mode" for moments when you want to journal without wondering if peering eyes are reading what you type.

If you take a break and forget where you left off, there is a "Show Last Sentence" option that will show you the last sentence that was typed during the session.

Enjoy!
